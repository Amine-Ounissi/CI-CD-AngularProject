The goal of our project:
1. For each click on the build button, the source code of the application which is under the GitHub tool will be quickly integrated into the latter's workspace.
2. Integrate Ansible Playbook Tasks with Jenkins to ensure automation of deployment of the application on Docker containers, as well as the backup on dockerhub.

## Tools :
Git, Jenkins, Ansible and Docker
